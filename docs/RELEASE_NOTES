The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first alpha release of the Nag Task
List Manager version H4 (3.0).

Nag is a web-based application built upon the Horde Application Framework which
provides a simple, clean interface for managing online task lists (i.e., todo
lists).  It also includes strong integration with the other Horde applications
and allows users to share task lists or enable light-weight project management.

IMPORTANT! This is a preview version that should not be used on production
systems. This version is considered feature complete but there are likely to be
bugs. You should not use this preview version with existing production
data. Migration of data from earlier versions has not been fully tested yet and
is not supported.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the release candidates are prepared.

The major changes compared to the Nag version H4 (2.3) are:

    * Updated for Horde 4
    * New Ajax frontend (through Kronolith)
    * System task lists
    * Task list coloring
    * Quick task adding
