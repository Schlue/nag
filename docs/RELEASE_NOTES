The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the Nag
Task List Manager version H4 (3.0).

Nag is a web-based application built upon the Horde Application Framework which
provides a simple, clean interface for managing online task lists (i.e., todo
lists). It also includes strong integration with the other Horde applications
and allows users to share task lists or enable light-weight project management.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome.

To install Nag, you need to install Horde first. See
https://github.com/horde/horde/blob/master/horde/docs/INSTALL for details. Once
Horde is installed, you can install Nag with the following command:

  pear install horde/nag-beta

Then log in to Horde with your adminstrator account to configure the
application and install the database schema from the configuration interface.

The major changes compared to the Nag version H4 (3.0-BETA1) are:

    * Finished Kolab support
    * Updated installation and upgrade instructions

The full list of changes (from version H4 (3.0-BETA1)) can be viewed here:

Have fun!

The Horde Team.
