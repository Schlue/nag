The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the Nag
Task List Manager version H5 (4.2.0).

Nag is a web-based application built upon the Horde Application Framework which
provides a simple, clean interface for managing online task lists (i.e., todo
lists). It also includes CalDAV support, strong integration with the other
Horde applications, and allows users to share task lists or enable light-weight
project management.

Barring any problems, this code will be released as Nag H5 (4.2.0).  We
encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system.  Updated translations are very welcome, strings should not
change before the final release.

For upgrading instructions, please see
